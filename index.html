                    My name is Ricardo Cabrera, ever since I moved to the states back in 2006, the older crowd at church
                    mainly
                    formed of "baby boomers" loved my personality and gave me the nick name of Ricky Ricardo, a
                    reference to the
                    popular show "I Love Lucy". El Salvador native, moved to the US at 13 years of age, grew up in San
                    Antonio,
                    TX where I learned a whole new language, completed Middle School and High School and of course made
                    lots of
                    friends.</p>


                <p>Following that I Attended The University of Nevada, Las Vegas and moved to the San Francisco Bay Area
                    upon
                    completion of my Bachelor of Science in Business Administration in Hospitality Management. In the
                    Bay Area I
                    started working as a Sales Manager for PSAV, an audio visual event technology company putting
                    meeting and
                    events together for hotels and conferences in the area. </p>
                <p>After completing my Bachelors I told my self I was never going back to school, forward 18 months
                    later and I
                    wanted to enroll myself in school again. I came to the realization that I loved and missed school,
                    but this
                    time I came back ready to take on a bigger challenge and I said why not learn how to code? I am
                    happy,
                    satisfied and excited to be taking this next step in my career and enhance my knowledge into the Web
                    Development world.</p>
